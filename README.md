1 - Multi-Lingual Sentiment Analysis
The goal of this competition is to explore fine-tuning as an art, understanding how LoRA-based parameter-efficient fine-tuning can help extend and improve the multilingual 
capabilities of a large-scale model like LLaMA 3.1-8B. Participants must balance data efficiency, compute limitations (Kaggle Notebooks only), and model adaptation 
techniques to achieve high sentiment classification accuracy across all supported languages.
